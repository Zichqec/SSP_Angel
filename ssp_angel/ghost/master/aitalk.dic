		"\1\b[0]\s[10]\0\b[0]\s[astonished]So like,\w4 I know you showed me how to place arrows and stuff on my #balloons by checking the coordinates in a different program,\w4 but lately I've actually just been setting the #balloon scaling really high and eyeballing it.\w8\w8\n\n\1\s[k_thinking]I suppose that is a valid method,\w4 so long as you are achieving the result you desire...\w8\w8\n\n\0\s[blush]\i[31]Yeah,\w4 it's been pretty great!\w8\w8 It really helps that I've been using that \_a[https://ukagaka.zichqec.com/guide/negative_coordinates_in_balloons]negative coordinate trick\_a you showed me,\w4 too,\w4 so that I don't have to move stuff around for each size of #balloon!"

		"\0\b[0]\s[0]\1\b[0]\s[teach]If you would like to save a log of all the #SHIORI events being sent to your #ghost,\w4 you can turn on the%(br)""Write SHIORI call log"" option in the dev palette.\w8\w8 It may be useful for debugging,\w4 especially for bugs that only come up at random.\w8\w8\n\n\0\s[sweat_smile]Oh,\w4 but make sure you turn it off when you're done.\w8\w8\i[31] The files can get REALLY long.\w8\w8\s[sweat_smile]\i[5] Ask me how I know,\w4 ha...\w8\w8\n\n\1\s[face_exhaling]"
		
		"\0\b[0]\s[0]\1\b[0]\s[teach]In the #SSP preferences you can change what level of error will give you an alert.\w8\w8 While developing a ghost,\w4 it is recommended to set the ""error notification%(br)level"" option to ""notice"" so that you will be notified of various issues and can resolve them before your ghost is released.\w8\w8\n\n\0\s[sweat_smile]\i[31]You can also do it the other way around and make it only notify you of critical errors,\w4 which can be a welcome relief if you've got a lot of #shell errors bugging you,\w4 but um...\w8\w8\s[sweat_smile]\i[5]\i[22] Just don't be like me and forget that you changed the error level,\w4 or you might not even realize you have errors,\w4 and end up releasing your #ghost with errors still present...\w8\w8\n\n\1\s[k_thinking]Yes,\w4 users tend to find it rather annoying when a%(br)#ghost gives them an error message every time it boots.\w8\w8 I recommend not putting the error%(br)notification level above the default setting unless you are not a developer at all."
		
		"\0\b[0]\s[0]\1\b[0]\s[teach]There are various different ways of reloading a #ghost.\w8\w8%(br)You can reload through the ""Utilities"" tab,\w4 and this will allow the ghost to comment on the reloading procedure.\w8\w8\s[neutral_face] You can also use the dev palette,\w4 for quicker reloading.\w8\w8 Click on the ""Reload..."" option,\w4 and you will be presented with a dropdown menu.\w8\w8 The ""#Ghost"" option will reload the entire #ghost,\w4 similarly to the Utilities tab,\w4 but without any dialogue.\w8\w8 The ""#SHIORI"" option will reload just the parts handled by the #SHIORI.\w8\w8 So in a #ghost made in%(br)#YAYA,\w4 that would be yaya.dll and all the .dic files.\w8\w8 This option is extremely fast,\w4 and may be nearly instantaneous.\w8\w8\n\n\0\s[astonished]Wow,\w4 really?\w8\w8\n\n\1\s[neutral_face]Yes.\w8\w8 There is also a ""#Shell"" option for reloading just the #shell of the ghost,\w4 and a ""#Balloon"" option for reloading just the #balloon.\w8\w8\n\n\0\s[blush]\i[22]That sounds really useful for if you're just working on one area of the #ghost!\w8\w8\n\n\1\s[neutral_face]Indeed.\w8\w8\s[k_thinking] Though,\w4 at times you may find that the different forms of reloading don't seem to take effect properly.\w8\w8 This is very rare,\w4 but if something doesn't seem to be reloading properly,\w4 you may try closing and reopening the #ghost,\w4 or even restarting%(br)#SSP entirely.\w8\w8\n\n\0\s[astonished]Oh,\w4 yeah,\w4 I've had that happen.\w8\w8\s[sweat_smile]\i[21] A couple of times I've%(br)actually had to completely restart my computer,\w4 because something weird was going on with the OS...\w8\w8\s[blush]\i[24]\i[31]%(br)After that it cleared right up!\w8\w8\s[relieved]\i[24] The old ""turn it off and on again"" trick fixes everything."

		"\1\b[0]\s[10]\0\b[0]\s[astonished]Did you know you can change how #.nar files are saved?\w8\w8 By default it'll ask where you want it to save them each time,\w4 but you can also set it up to save the file in the same place as the directory it's archiving,\w4 or even set up a custom folder for it to always save them into!\w8\w8\s[blush]\i[31] Neat,\w4 right?"
		
		"\1\b[0]\s[10]\0\b[0]\s[blush]\i[22]Hey,\w4 quick dev tip!\w8\w8 One of the easiest mistakes to make is to forget to initialize your variables and stuff properly when the #ghost first boots!\w8\w8 So,\w4 always make sure that before you release a #ghost for the first time,\w4 you try doing a fresh install in a separate copy of #SSP!\w8\w8\s[sweat_smile]\i[24] It'll save you TONS of trouble on your first release,\w4 believe me.\w8\w8\n\n\1\s[k_thinking]Yes,\w4 first impressions are important,\w4 and it is rather a shame when a #ghost is released in a non-functional state.\w8\w8 It may seem like extra hassle,\w4 but doing a fresh install is very different from simply testing the OnFirstBoot event's dialogue.\w8\w8\s[neutral_face] It is worth the effort."
		
		"\0\b[0]\s[0]\1\b[0]\s[teach]If you are trying to get network updates working,\w4 you should make use of the network log.\w8\w8 You can open the script log with Ctrl + L,\w4 and then change it to the network log by clicking the dropdown in the bottom left corner,\w4 and changing it from ""Script"" to%(br)""Network"".\w8\w8 This will show userful information such as the exact URL being used,\w4 and what sort of errors there are."
