This ghost serves as a guide to SSP, and also a fun companion! They primarily focus on giving the user SSP usage tips and advice, but they also have plenty of non-SSP content for folks that are already experienced with the program.

If you're new to ghosts: double click on the characters to open their menus. They'll explain from there!
